# ICS-WebUntis

ICS-WebUntis is a lightweight service that exports timetables from [WebUntis](https://www.untis.at/) as iCal/ ICS calendar feeds.

It is designed for reliability, minimal resource usage, and straightforward deployment via Docker.

## Features

- Fetch timetables directly from WebUntis
- Expose an iCal calendar endpoint for integration with any calendar client
- Built-in caching to reduce load on WebUntis
- Single-container deployment with Docker
- Strictly validated configuration
- Multiple Users supported
- Fetch timetables for specific classes, rooms, teachers, or subjects by name or numeric ID
- Multiple language support with automatic detection and user-specific language settings (currently supports English and German)
- Configurable handling of cancelled lessons
- Optional per-user inclusion of school holidays
- Optional per-user access token protection

## Quick Start

### Run with Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
    webuntis-timetable:
        image: nlion/ics-webuntis:latest
        container_name: webuntis-timetable
        environment:
            - NODE_ENV=production
            - PORT=7464
            - CONFIG_FILE=/app/config.json
        volumes:
            - ./dev-config.json:/app/config.json:ro
        ports:
            - "7464:7464"
        restart: unless-stopped
```

Start it with 'docker-compose up'

This will fail without a 'config.json'

## Configuration

The service requires a JSON configuration file.

`config.json` example

```json

    "daysBefore": 7,
    "daysAfter": 14,
    "cacheDuration": 300,

            "showHolidays": true,
            "accessToken": "my-secret-token"
        }
    ]
}

## Usage

### Personal timetable

```text
http://<host>:7464/timetable/friendlyName
```

`<friendlyName>` is the one specified in the user configuration

Returns the personal timetable as an iCal/ ICS feed

If an access token is configured, append ?access_token=my-secret:

```text
http://<host>:7464/timetable/friendlyName?access_token=my-secret
```

### Specific element timetable (class, room, teacher, subject)

`<type>`: `"class"`, `"room"`, `"teacher"`, or `"subject"`

`<id>` Either the numeric ID or the name of the element (the service will resolve the name automatically)

Example URLs:

`http://localhost:7464/timetable/student1/class/10.3`

`http://localhost:7464/timetable/student1/room/24`

`http://localhost:7464/timetable/student1/teacher/MrSmith?lang=de`

Replace `student1` with the friendly name of your user, and `class/10.3` with the desired type and ID.

If the ID cannot be resolved, the service will attempt to use it as a numeric ID.

### Exams and homework feeds

```text
http://<host>:7464/timetable/friendlyName/exams
http://<host>:7464/timetable/friendlyName/homework
```

Returns upcoming exams or homework (within the configured `daysBefore`/`daysAfter` range) as a separate iCal/ ICS feed. Unlike the personal and element timetable endpoints, they do not accept a `<id>` (class/room/teacher/subject) segment.

### Different languages

The service supports multiple languages and will attempt to detect the preferred language for each request. The detection order is as follows:

1. Query parameter `lang` (e.g., `?lang=en`)
2. User-specific language setting from the configuration file
3. `Accepted-Language` header from the request (your browser or calendar client should set this automatically based on your system settings)

### Cancelled lessons display

The `cancelledDisplay` option in the user configuration allows you to control how cancelled lessons are handled in the generated iCal/ ICS feed:

- `hide`: Cancelled lessons will be completely excluded from the feed.
- `show`: Cancelled lessons will be included and marked with `STATUS:CANCELLED`, allowing calendar clients to display them differently (e.g., crossed out).
- `mark`: Same as `show` but extra text is added to the lesson title (e.g., "Math - CANCELLED")

### Holidays

The `showHolidays` option in the user configuration controls whether school holidays are included as all-day entries in the generated feed. It defaults to `true`; set it to `false` for a user if you only want lesson entries in their calendar.

### URL parameters

The following query parameters can be used to override the default behavior for a specific request:

- `lang`: Override the detected language for this request (e.g., `?lang=en`)
- `cancelledDisplay`: Override the cancelled lessons display setting for this request (e.g., `?cancelledDisplay=mark`)
- `access_token`: Access token (if configured) in format `?access_token=my-secret`
